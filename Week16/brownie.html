    <div align="center">
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <p>- 1/2 cup butter</p>
        <p>- 1 cup white sugar</p>
        <p>- 2 eggs</p>
        <p>- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
        <p>- 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</p>
        <p>- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour</p>
        <p>- 1/4 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder</p>
        <h3>Tools:</h3>
        <p>- 1 large bowl</p>
        <p>- 1 small bowl</p>
        <p>- 1 whisk</p>
        <p>- 1 spatula</p>
        <p>- 1 baking tray</p>
        <p>- 1 baking paper</p>
        <p>- 1 oven</p>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <div align="left">
            <p>1. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>2. Put the butter and chocolate in a large bowl and melt them in the microwave. (You can also melt them in a bain-marie, but I prefer the microwave method because it is faster.)</p>
            <p>3. While the chocolate and butter are melting, put the eggs and sugar in a small bowl and whisk them until they are well mixed.</p>
            <p>4. When the chocolate and butter are melted, add the egg and sugar mixture to the large bowl and mix them well with a spatula.</p>
            <p>5. Add the flour, salt and vanilla extract to the large bowl and mix them well with a spatula.</p>
            <p>6. Put the baking paper on the baking tray and pour the mixture on it. Spread the mixture evenly on the tray.</p>
            <p>7. Put the tray in the oven and bake for 20 minutes.</p>
            <p>8. After 20 minutes, take the tray out of the oven and let it cool for 10 minutes.</p>
            <p>9. After 10 minutes, cut the brownie into squares and serve.</p>
